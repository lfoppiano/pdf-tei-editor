# Authentication

The PDF-TEI Editor requires user authentication to access documents and manage permissions.

The application will prompt for username and password automatically if no user is logged in. Each window or tab has its own user session.

## User management

For details on the management of users and roles, see the [README](https://github.com/mpilhlt/pdf-tei-editor/blob/main/README.md#authentication-and-user-management).
